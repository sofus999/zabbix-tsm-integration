## Getting Started

### Prerequisites for Development

1. **Testing Environment**
   - Access to IBM Storage Protect test instance
   - Zabbix development/test environment
   - Red Hat Linux or compatible OS for testing

2. **Required Knowledge**
   - Bash scripting
   - IBM Storage Protect (TSM) administration
   - Zabbix configuration and templating
   - JSON and YAML formats

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up a test environment with:
   - Zabbix proxy/server
   - IBM Storage Protect client
   - Test TSM instance access

## üìù Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- Check existing [issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicate work
- Create an issue to discuss major changes before implementation
- Review the [project documentation](README.md) thoroughly

### 2. Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Follow Coding Standards**
   - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for shell scripts)
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow existing naming conventions
   - Include error handling in scripts

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Test scripts manually in your environment
   - Verify Zabbix template functionality
   - Check for performance impact
   - Ensure backward compatibility

### 3. Submitting Changes

1. **Commit Guidelines**
   ```bash
   # Use descriptive commit messages
   git commit -m "Add container monitoring timeout handling"
   
   # For bug fixes
   git commit -m "Fix authentication failure in discovery script"
   
   # For documentation
   git commit -m "Update installation guide for RHEL 9"
   ```

2. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create a pull request from your feature branch
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include testing details

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Script Testing

```bash
# Test basic functionality
./storage_protect_dsmadmc.sh -i test_instance -u user -p pass -q "q status"

# Test error handling
./storage_protect_dsmadmc.sh -i invalid_instance -u user -p pass -q "q status"

# Test timeout scenarios
./storage_protect_dsmadmc.sh -i slow_instance -u user -p pass -q "q sessions" -t 5
```

### Template Testing

1. Import templates in test Zabbix environment
2. Verify discovery rules work correctly
3. Check item collection and trigger functionality
4. Test with multiple TSM instances
5. Validate JSON output formats

### Performance Testing

- Monitor script execution times
- Check memory usage during execution
- Verify cleanup processes work correctly
- Test concurrent script execution

### Production-Critical Testing

Before contributing changes, test these critical scenarios:

```bash
# File descriptor exhaustion testing
# Monitor file descriptor usage during script execution
watch -n 1 'lsof | grep zabbix | wc -l'

# Process hanging simulation
# Kill scripts mid-execution and verify cleanup
kill -9 <script_pid>
ps aux | grep dsmadmc  # Should show no hanging processes

# Concurrent execution testing
# Run multiple scripts simultaneously and verify lock mechanisms
./script1.sh & ./script2.sh & ./script3.sh &

# Memory usage monitoring during extended runs
while true; do
    ps aux | grep dsmadmc | awk '{sum+=$6} END {print "Memory:", sum "KB"}'
    sleep 30
done
```

## üìã Code Standards

### Shell Script Standards

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script description and purpose
# Author: Your Name
# Version: 1.0

set -o pipefail  # Use pipefail for better error handling

# Function naming: use lowercase with underscores
check_tsm_connectivity() {
    local instance="$1"
    local timeout="${2:-30}"
    
    # Always include parameter validation
    if [[ -z "$instance" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Instance parameter required" >&2
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Implementation here
}

# Variable naming: use uppercase for constants, lowercase for variables
readonly TSM_CLIENT_PATH="/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin"
local result=""

# Error handling: always check return codes
if ! run_command; then
    echo "Error: Command failed" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

### Zabbix Template Standards

- Use descriptive names for items, triggers, and discovery rules
- Include units for numeric values
- Set appropriate history and trend retention
- Use macros for configurable values
- Include proper trigger dependencies
- Add meaningful descriptions

### Documentation Standards

- Include practical examples
- Provide troubleshooting information
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use proper Markdown formatting
